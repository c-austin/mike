Notes:
    Landing page won't be scrollable. You hit it, and you can click a link and it will take you to that part, which will be scrollable to the other parts.

    Header/Nav:
        For home:
            Desktop looks as is
            Mobile.... horizontal list underneath... maybe two row?

        For other:
            Desktop looks as is (No highlighting of the active page to start)
            Mobile will be a hamburder drop down

    TODO:
        HOME NAV FOR MOBILE
        MAKE HOME LINK WORK FOR SVG
        LINKS TO TIX!
        Footer w/ links to other stuff
